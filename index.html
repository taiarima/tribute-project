        <h2>A Brief Biography</h2>
        <hr class="divider" />
        <p>
          Fan Deng was born to a middle class family in Xi'an, China on March
          24, 1976. Although his parents were both teachers, he grew up as a
          typical student, not being particularly passionate towards education.
          As a student, he said that he hated exams, and some of his teachers
          remarked that his grades were good, but not outstanding. Indeed, Fan
          Deng celebrated after graduating from his master's degree program by
          throwing away all of his textbooks and swearing to his friends that he
          would never study again.

          After gaining attention during his college years as a skillful member
          of his university's debate team, Fan Deng began a career working as a
          television host in 2001. He began his career with high levels of
          confidence, but quickly discovered that none of his television
          programs gained traction. After trying everything he could think of to
          resolve the situation, he felt like his back was against a wall.
          Finally, he turned to books in search of a solution.

        <p>
          One of the first books which Fan Deng focused on was "7 Habits of
          Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey. This was perhaps his first
          experience of studying with books to meet his own personal goals,
          rather than just studying to meet the expectations of others. Through
          this experience he discovered the joy of reading and learning through
          books, and eagerly continued his reading journey with the works of
          Confucius and other significant authors.

          After giving up his career in television, Fan Deng became a lecturer
          at Beijing Jiaotong University in 2007. At the time he began giving
          lectures on leadership, based both upon his professional experience,
          and lessons that he learned from books. He became a popular lecturer
          thanks to his ability to summarize information succinctly in a manner
          which could hold the audience's attention. After several years of
          success with his lectures, he felt the desire to share the lessons he
          learned from books on a variety of topics more widely. He found the
          information he learned in books invaluable, but discovered that people
          often were unable to keep up a book habit. He found that people often
          have the desire to read, but are unable to effectively synthesize the
          information they read, are not able to make the time to read, or
          become overwhelmed when they aren't sure which books they shoudl
          choose.

          To surmount these diffulties, Fan Deng founded the Fan Deng Reading
          Club in 2013. The goal of the organization is to help as many people
          as possible gain access to great ideas and information in books. Among
          other resources offered by the organiztaion, the most popular offering
          is the weekly lecturers delivered by Fan Deng. Each week he gives a
          lecture, typically 45-60 minutes, summarizing the main ideas of a
          book. Not only does he clearly explain the content of each book, he
          ties back the ideas with other books he has previously presented,
          gives examples and anecdotes, draws relations to modern Chinese
          society and Chinese philosophy, and offers suggestions of how the
          information can be applied to improve our lives. While Fan Deng
          focused on practical non-fiction and personal development in the early
          years, topics now span everything from math and science to philosophy
          and history. To date, he has delivered lecturers on over 400 books,
          and the Fan Deng Reading Club application has accumulated over 60
          million users.
