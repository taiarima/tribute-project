        <h2>A Brief Biography</h2>
        <hr class="divider" />
        <p>
          Fan Deng was born to a middle class family in Xi'an, China on March
          24, 1976. Although his parents were both teachers, he grew up as a
          typical student, not being particularly passionate towards education.
          As a student, he said that he hated exams, and some of his teachers
          remarked that his grades were good, but not outstanding. Indeed, Fan
          Deng celebrated after graduating from his master's degree program by
          throwing away all of his textbooks and swearing to his friends that he
          would never study again.
        </p>
        <p>
          After gaining attention during his college years as a skillful member
          of his university's debate team, Fan Deng began a career working as a
          television host in 2001. He began his career with high levels of
          confidence, but quickly discovered that none of his television
          programs gained traction. After trying everything he could think of to
          resolve the situation, he felt like his back was against a wall.
          Finally, he turned to books in search of a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the first books that Fan Deng turned to was "7 Habits of Highly
          Effective People" by Stephen Covey. It was a pivotal moment for him as
          it marked his first foray into self-directed learning and
          goal-setting, rather than solely studying to meet the expectations of
          others. This experience ignited a passion for reading and encouraged
          him to continue his literary journey with the works of Confucius and
          other notable authors. Fan Deng's dedication to reading during this
          period proved to be a transformative experience, convincing him of the
          value of life-long learning and the profound impact that books can
          have on an individual's personal growth and development

          After stepping away from his television career, Fan Deng transitioned
          to become a lecturer at Beijing Jiaotong University in 2007. He
          initially focused on delivering lectures on leadership based on his
          professional experience and insights gleaned from books. Thanks to his
          talent for succinctly summarizing complex concepts in an engaging
          manner, he quickly became a popular lecturer. However, after several
          years, he felt a strong urge to share the valuable lessons he had
          learned from books on a wider range of topics. Fan Deng recognized
          that many people struggled to cultivate a consistent reading habit,
          often finding it difficult to synthesize the information they read,
          lacking the time to dedicate to reading, or feeling overwhelmed by the
          abundance of books to choose from.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2013, Fan Deng founded the Fan Deng Reading Club as a means of
          helping people overcome the difficulties of accessing great ideas and
          information in books. The organization provides a range of resources,
          but the weekly lectures delivered by Fan Deng have proven to be the
          most popular. During these 45-60 minute lectures, he not only
          summarizes the main ideas of a book, but also draws connections
          between it and other works, provides examples and anecdotes, relates
          the ideas to modern Chinese society and Chinese philosophy, and
          suggests practical applications for improving our lives. While Fan
          Deng initially focused on practical non-fiction and personal
          development, the topics now span a wide range, including math,
          science, philosophy, and history. To date, he has delivered over 400
          lectures, attracting more than 60 million users to the Fan Deng
          Reading Club application.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of April 2023, the Fan Deng Reading Club is still running strong.
          Fan Deng continues his mission to share knowledge, to try to help more
          and more people develop a reading habit, and spread recognition of
          books and authors that may go unnoticed.
