        <h2>A Brief Biography</h2>
        <hr class="divider" />
        <p>
          Fan Deng was born to a middle class family in Xi'an, China on March
          24, 1976. Although his parents were both teachers, he grew up as a
          typical student, not being particularly passionate towards education.
          As a student, he said that he hated exams, and some of his teachers
          remarked that his grades were good, but not outstanding. Indeed, Fan
          Deng celebrated after graduating from his master's degree program by
          throwing away all of his textbooks and swearing to his friends that he
          would never study again.

          After gaining attention during his college years as a skillful member
          of his university's debate team, Fan Deng began a career working as a
          television host. He began his career with high levels of confidence,
          but quickly discovered that none of his television programs gained
          traction. After trying everything he could think of to resolve the
          situation, he felt like his back was against a wall. Finally, he
          turned to books in search of a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the first books which Fan Deng focused on was "7 Habits of
          Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey.
